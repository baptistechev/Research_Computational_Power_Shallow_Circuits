# Computational Power of Shallow Circuits

Shallow circuits separation have been shown by Bravyi, et al., Quantum advantage with shallow circuits, Science (2018)
We aim at extending this separation to more arbitrary setup, notably focusing on sequential circuits.
To do so, we exploit the graph state representation of any quantum algorihtm used in MBQC.
We show that correlation between the measurements arised and cannot be reproduced by classical computers.
